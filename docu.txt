Telegram Mini Apps
With Mini Apps developers can use JavaScript to create infinitely flexible interfaces that can be launched right inside Telegram — and can completely replace any website.

Like bots, Mini Apps support seamless authorization, payments via third-party payment providers (with Google Pay and Apple Pay out of the box), delivering tailored push notifications to users, and much more.

Designing Mini Apps
Color Schemes
Mini Apps always receive data about the user's current color theme in real time, so you can adjust the appearance of your interfaces to match it. For example, when users switch between Day and Night modes or use various custom themes.

Jump to technical information

Design Guidelines
Telegram apps are known for being snappy, smooth and following a consistent cross-platform design. Your Mini App should ideally reflect these principles.

All elements should be responsive and designed with a mobile-first approach.
Interactive elements should mimic the style, behavior, and intent of UI components that already exist.
All included animations should be smooth, ideally 60fps.
All inputs and images should contain labels for accessibility purposes.
The app should deliver a seamless experience by monitoring the dynamic theme-based colors provided by the API and using them accordingly.
Ensure that the app’s interface respects the safe area and content safe area to avoid overlapping with control elements, especially when using fullscreen mode.
For Android devices, consider the additional information in the User-Agent (see User-Agent details) and adjust for the device’s performance class, minimizing animations and visual effects on low-performance devices to ensure smooth performance.
Implementing Mini Apps
Telegram currently supports seven different ways of launching Mini Apps: the main Mini App from a profile button, from a keyboard button, from an inline button, from the bot menu button, via inline mode, from a direct link – and even from the attachment menu.

Types of buttons
Keyboard Button Mini Apps
TL;DR: Mini Apps launched from a web_app type keyboard button can send data back to the bot in a service message using Telegram.WebApp.sendData. This makes it possible for the bot to produce a response without communicating with any external servers.

Users can interact with bots using custom keyboards, buttons under bot messages, as well as by sending freeform text messages or any of the attachment types supported by Telegram: photos and videos, files, locations, contacts and polls. For even more flexibility, bots can utilize the full power of HTML5 to create user-friendly input interfaces.

You can send a web_app type KeyboardButton that opens a Mini App from the specified URL.

To transmit data from the user back to the bot, the Mini App can call the Telegram.WebApp.sendData method. Data will be transmitted to the bot as a String in a service message. The bot can continue communicating with the user after receiving it.

Good for:

Сustom data input interfaces (a personalized calendar for selecting dates; selecting data from a list with advanced search options; a randomizer that lets the user “spin a wheel” and chooses one of the available options, etc.)
Reusable components that do not depend on a particular bot.
Inline Button Mini Apps
TL;DR: For more interactive Mini Apps like @DurgerKingBot, use a web_app type Inline KeyboardButton, which gets basic user information and can be used to send a message on behalf of the user to the chat with the bot.

If receiving text data alone is insufficient or you need a more advanced and personalized interface, you can open a Mini App using a web_app type Inline KeyboardButton.

From the button, a Mini App will open with the URL specified in the button. In addition to the user's theme settings, it will receive basic user information (ID, name, username, language_code) and a unique identifier for the session, query_id, which allows messages on behalf of the user to be sent back to the bot.

The bot can call the Bot API method answerWebAppQuery to send an inline message from the user back to the bot and close the Mini App. After receiving the message, the bot can continue communicating with the user.

Good for:

Fully-fledged web services and integrations of any kind.
The use cases are effectively unlimited.
Launching Mini Apps from the Menu Button
TL;DR: Mini Apps can be launched from a customized menu button. This simply offers a quicker way to access the app and is otherwise identical to launching a mini app from an inline button.

By default, chats with bots always show a convenient menu button that provides quick access to all listed commands. With Bot API 6.0, this button can be used to launch a Mini App instead.

To configure the menu button, you must specify the text it should show and the Mini App URL. There are two ways to set these parameters:

To customize the button for all users, use @BotFather (the /setmenubutton command or Bot Settings > Menu Button).
To customize the button for both all users and specific users, use the setChatMenuButton method in the Bot API. For example, change the button text according to the user's language, or show links to different Mini Apps based on a user's settings in your bot.
Apart from this, Mini Apps opened via the menu button work in the exact same way as when using inline buttons.

@DurgerKingBot allows launching its Mini App both from an inline button and from the menu button.

Launching the main Mini App
TL;DR: If your bot is a mini app, you can add a prominent Launch app button as well as high-quality demo videos and screenshots to the bot’s profile. To do this, go to @BotFather and set up your bot's Main Mini App.

If your bot is a mini app, you can unlock a number of features that streamline and simplify the way in which users view and interact with it. To do this, go to @BotFather and set up your bot's Main Mini App.

After setting a main mini app, you'll be able to upload detailed media preview demos to publicly highlight your app's key features on its profile. A Launch app button will also appear, allowing users to open your app directly from its profile. Bots that enabled a main mini app will be displayed in the Apps tab of the search for users who have launched them.

Media previews support multiple languages – so you can upload translated versions of your previews that will be shown to users based on their app language.

A bot's main Mini App can also be opened in the current chat by direct link in the format https://t.me/botusername?startapp. If a non-empty startapp parameter is included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the start_param field and in the GET parameter tgWebAppStartParam.

Examples

https://t.me/botusername?startapp
https://t.me/botusername?startapp=command
https://t.me/botusername?startapp=command&mode=compact

In this mode, Mini Apps can use the chat_type and chat_instance parameters to keep track of the current chat context. This introduces support for concurrent and shared usage by multiple chat members – to create live whiteboards, group orders, multiplayer games and similar apps.

By default, the main Mini App opens to full-screen height, and users cannot reduce them to half-height. However, you can change this behavior via @BotFather or by including the parameter mode=compact in the link to the Mini App, in which case it will open to half-screen height by default.

Good for:

Fully-fledged web services and integrations that any user can open in one tap.
Cooperative, multiplayer or teamwork-oriented services within a chat context.
The use cases are effectively unlimited.
Successful bots which enable a main Mini App and accept payments in Telegram Stars may be featured in the Telegram Mini App Store. To increase the chances of being featured, we recommend uploading high-quality media showcasing your app on your bot's profile and following our design guidelines.

Inline Mode Mini Apps
TL;DR: Mini Apps launched via web_app type InlineQueryResultsButton can be used anywhere in inline mode. Users can create content in a web interface and then seamlessly send it to the current chat via inline mode.

You can use the button parameter in the answerInlineQuery method to display a special 'Switch to Mini App' button either above or in place of the inline results. This button will open a Mini App from the specified URL. Once done, you can call the Telegram.WebApp.switchInlineQuery method to send the user back to inline mode.

Inline Mini Apps have no access to the chat – they can't read messages or send new ones on behalf of the user. To send messages, the user must be redirected to inline mode and actively pick a result.

Good for:

Fully-fledged web services and integrations in inline mode.
Direct Link Mini Apps
TL;DR: Mini App Bots can be launched from a direct link in any chat. They support a startapp parameter and are aware of the current chat context.

You can use direct links to open a Mini App directly in the current chat. If a non-empty startapp parameter is included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the start_param field and in the GET parameter tgWebAppStartParam.

In this mode, Mini Apps can use the chat_type and chat_instance parameters to keep track of the current chat context. This introduces support for concurrent and shared usage by multiple chat members – to create live whiteboards, group orders, multiplayer games and similar apps.

Mini Apps opened from a direct link have no access to the chat – they can't read messages or send new ones on behalf of the user. To send messages, the user must be redirected to inline mode and actively pick a result.

Starting from Bot API 7.6, by default, Mini Apps of this type open to full-screen height, and users cannot reduce them to half-height. However, you can change this behavior by including the parameter mode=compact in the link to the Mini App, in which case it will open to half-screen height by default.

Examples

https://t.me/botusername/appname
https://t.me/botusername/appname?startapp=command
https://t.me/botusername/appname?startapp=command&mode=compact

Good for:

Fully-fledged web services and integrations that any user can open in one tap.
Cooperative, multiplayer or teamwork-oriented services within a chat context.
The use cases are effectively unlimited.
Launching Mini Apps from the Attachment Menu
TL;DR: Mini App Bots can request to be added directly to a user's attachment menu, allowing them to be quickly launched from any chat. To try this mode, open this attachment menu link for @DurgerKingBot, then use the Attach menu in any type of chat.

Mini App Bots can request to be added directly to a user's attachment menu, allowing them to be quickly launched from any type of chat. You can configure in which types of chats your mini app can be started from the attachment menu (private, groups, supergroups or channels).

Attachment menu integration is currently only available for major advertisers on the Telegram Ad Platform. However, all bots can use it in the test server environment.

To enable this feature for your bot, open @BotFather from an account on the test server and send the /setattach command – or go to Bot Settings > Configure Attachment Menu. Then specify the URL that will be opened to launch the bot's Mini App via its icon in the attachment menu.

You can add a 'Settings' item to the context menu of your Mini App using @BotFather. When users select this option from the menu, your bot will receive a settingsButtonClicked event.

In addition to the user's theme settings, the bot will receive basic user information (ID, name, username, language_code, photo), as well as public info about the chat partner (ID, name, username, photo) or the chat info (ID, type, title, username, photo) and a unique identifier for the web view session query_id, which allows messages of any type to be sent to the chat on behalf of the user that opened the bot.

The bot can call the Bot API method answerWebAppQuery, which sends an inline message from the user via the bot to the chat where it was launched and closes the Mini App.

You can read more about adding bots to the attachment menu here.

Initializing Mini Apps
To connect your Mini App to the Telegram client, place the script telegram-web-app.js in the <head> tag before any other scripts, using this code:

<script src="https://telegram.org/js/telegram-web-app.js?59"></script>
Once the script is connected, a window.Telegram.WebApp object will become available with the following fields:

Field	Type	Description
initData	String	A string with raw data transferred to the Mini App, convenient for validating data.
WARNING: Validate data from this field before using it on the bot's server.
initDataUnsafe	WebAppInitData	An object with input data transferred to the Mini App.
WARNING: Data from this field should not be trusted. You should only use data from initData on the bot's server and only after it has been validated.
version	String	The version of the Bot API available in the user's Telegram app.
platform	String	The name of the platform of the user's Telegram app.
colorScheme	String	The color scheme currently used in the Telegram app. Either “light” or “dark”.
Also available as the CSS variable var(--tg-color-scheme).
themeParams	ThemeParams	An object containing the current theme settings used in the Telegram app.
isActive NEW	Boolean	Bot API 8.0+ True, if the Mini App is currently active. False, if the Mini App is minimized.
isExpanded	Boolean	True, if the Mini App is expanded to the maximum available height. False, if the Mini App occupies part of the screen and can be expanded to the full height using the expand() method.
viewportHeight	Float	The current height of the visible area of the Mini App. Also available in CSS as the variable var(--tg-viewport-height).

The application can display just the top part of the Mini App, with its lower part remaining outside the screen area. From this position, the user can “pull” the Mini App to its maximum height, while the bot can do the same by calling the expand() method. As the position of the Mini App changes, the current height value of the visible area will be updated in real time.

Please note that the refresh rate of this value is not sufficient to smoothly follow the lower border of the window. It should not be used to pin interface elements to the bottom of the visible area. It's more appropriate to use the value of the viewportStableHeight field for this purpose.
viewportStableHeight	Float	The height of the visible area of the Mini App in its last stable state. Also available in CSS as a variable var(--tg-viewport-stable-height).

The application can display just the top part of the Mini App, with its lower part remaining outside the screen area. From this position, the user can “pull” the Mini App to its maximum height, while the bot can do the same by calling the expand() method. Unlike the value of viewportHeight, the value of viewportStableHeight does not change as the position of the Mini App changes with user gestures or during animations. The value of viewportStableHeight will be updated after all gestures and animations are completed and the Mini App reaches its final size.

Note the event viewportChanged with the passed parameter isStateStable=true, which will allow you to track when the stable state of the height of the visible area changes.
headerColor	String	Current header color in the #RRGGBB format.
backgroundColor	String	Current background color in the #RRGGBB format.
bottomBarColor	String	Current bottom bar color in the #RRGGBB format.
isClosingConfirmationEnabled	Boolean	True, if the confirmation dialog is enabled while the user is trying to close the Mini App. False, if the confirmation dialog is disabled.
isVerticalSwipesEnabled	Boolean	True, if vertical swipes to close or minimize the Mini App are enabled. False, if vertical swipes to close or minimize the Mini App are disabled. In any case, the user will still be able to minimize and close the Mini App by swiping the Mini App's header.
isFullscreen NEW	Boolean	True, if the Mini App is currently being displayed in fullscreen mode.
isOrientationLocked NEW	Boolean	True, if the Mini App’s orientation is currently locked. False, if orientation changes freely based on the device’s rotation.
safeAreaInset NEW	SafeAreaInset	An object representing the device's safe area insets, accounting for system UI elements like notches or navigation bars.
contentSafeAreaInset NEW	ContentSafeAreaInset	An object representing the safe area for displaying content within the app, free from overlapping Telegram UI elements.
BackButton	BackButton	An object for controlling the back button which can be displayed in the header of the Mini App in the Telegram interface.
MainButton	BottomButton	An object for controlling the main button, which is displayed at the bottom of the Mini App in the Telegram interface.
SecondaryButton	BottomButton	An object for controlling the secondary button, which is displayed at the bottom of the Mini App in the Telegram interface.
SettingsButton	SettingsButton	An object for controlling the Settings item in the context menu of the Mini App in the Telegram interface.
HapticFeedback	HapticFeedback	An object for controlling haptic feedback.
CloudStorage	CloudStorage	An object for controlling cloud storage.
BiometricManager	BiometricManager	An object for controlling biometrics on the device.
Accelerometer NEW	Accelerometer	An object for accessing accelerometer data on the device.
DeviceOrientation NEW	DeviceOrientation	An object for accessing device orientation data on the device.

This method is only available for Mini Apps launched via a Keyboard button.
switchInlineQuery(query[, choose_chat_types])	Function	Bot API 6.7+ A method that inserts the bot's username and the specified inline query in the current chat's input field. Query may be empty, in which case only the bot's username will be inserted. If an optional choose_chat_types parameter was passed, the client prompts the user to choose a specific chat, then opens that chat and inserts the bot's username and the specified inline query in the input field. You can specify which types of chats the user will be able to choose from. It can be one or more of the following types: users, bots, groups, channels.
openLink(url[, options])	Function	A method that opens a link in an external browser. The Mini App will not be closed.
Bot API 6.4+ If the optional options parameter is passed with the field try_instant_view=true, the link will be opened in Instant View mode if possible.

Note that this method can be called only in response to user interaction with the Mini App interface (e.g. a click inside the Mini App or on the main button)
openTelegramLink(url)	Function	A method that opens a telegram link inside the Telegram app. The Mini App will not be closed after this method is called.

Up to Bot API 7.0 The Mini App will be closed after this method is called.
openInvoice(url[, callback])	Function	Bot API 6.1+ A method that opens an invoice using the link url. The Mini App will receive the event invoiceClosed when the invoice is closed.

shareMessage(msg_id[, callback]) NEW	Function	Bot API 8.0+ A method that opens a dialog allowing the user to share a message provided by the bot. If an optional callback parameter is provided, the callback function will be called with a boolean as the first argument, indicating whether the message was successfully sent. The message id passed to this method must belong to a PreparedInlineMessage previously obtained via the Bot API method savePreparedInlineMessage.
setEmojiStatus(custom_emoji_id[, params, callback])	Function	Bot API 8.0+ A method that opens a dialog allowing the user to set the specified custom emoji as their status. An optional params argument of type EmojiStatusParams specifies additional settings, such as duration. If an optional callback parameter is provided, the callback function will be called with a boolean as the first argument, indicating whether the status was set.

Note: this method opens a native dialog and cannot be used to set the emoji status without manual user interaction. For fully programmatic changes, you should instead use the Bot API method setUserEmojiStatus after obtaining authorization to do so via the Mini App method requestEmojiStatusAccess.
requestEmojiStatusAccess([callback]) NEW	Function	Bot API 8.0+ A method that shows a native popup requesting permission for the bot to manage user's emoji status.

If the key was not found, the second argument will be null, and the third argument will be a boolean indicating whether the key can be restored from the current device.
restoreItem(key[, callback])	Function	Bot API 9.0+ Attempts to restore a key that previously existed on the current device. When called, the user will be asked for permission to restore the value. If the user declines or an error occurs, the first argument in the callback will contain the error. If restored successfully, the first argument will be null and the second argument will contain the restored value.
removeItem(key[, callback])	Function	Bot API 9.0+ A method that removes a value from the device's secure storage using the specified key. If an optional callback parameter was passed, the callback function will be called. In case of an error, the first argument will contain the error. In case of success, the first argument will be null and the second argument will be a boolean indicating whether the value was removed.
clear([callback])	Function	Bot API 9.0+ A method that clears all keys previously stored by the bot in the device's secure storage. If an optional callback parameter was passed, the callback function will be called. In case of an error, the first argument will contain the error. In case of success, the first argument will be null and the second argument will be a boolean indicating whether all values were removed.
All these methods return the SecureStorage object, so they can be chained.

Validating data received via the Mini App
To validate data received via the Mini App, one should send the data from the Telegram.WebApp.initData field to the bot's backend. The data is a query string, which is composed of a series of field-value pairs.

You can verify the integrity of the data received by comparing the received hash parameter with the hexadecimal representation of the HMAC-SHA-256 signature of the data-check-string with the secret key, which is the HMAC-SHA-256 signature of the bot's token with the constant string WebAppData used as a key.

Data-check-string is a chain of all received fields, sorted alphabetically, in the format key=<value> with a line feed character ('\n', 0x0A) used as separator – e.g., 'auth_date=<auth_date>\nquery_id=<query_id>\nuser=<user>'.

The full check might look like:

data_check_string = ...
secret_key = HMAC_SHA256(<bot_token>, "WebAppData")
if (hex(HMAC_SHA256(data_check_string, secret_key)) == hash) {
  // data is from Telegram
}
To prevent the use of outdated data, you can additionally check the auth_date field, which contains a Unix timestamp of when it was received by the Mini App.

Once validated, the data may be used on your server. Complex data types are represented as JSON-serialized objects.

Validating data for Third-Party Use
NEW If you need to share the data with a third party, they can validate the data without requiring access to your bot's token. Simply provide them with the data from the Telegram.WebApp.initData field and your bot_id.

The integrity of the data can be verified by validating the received signature parameter, which is the base64url-encoded representation of the Ed25519 signature of the data-check-string. The verification is performed using the public key provided by Telegram.

Data-check-string is constructed as follows:
1. Prepend the bot_id, followed by : and the constant string WebAppData.
2. Add a line feed character ('\n', 0x0A).
3. Append all received fields (except hash and signature), sorted alphabetically, in the format key=<value>.
4. Separate each key-value pair with a line feed character ('\n', 0x0A).

Example:
'12345678:WebAppData\nauth_date=<auth_date>\nquery_id=<query_id>\nuser=<user>'

The verification process might look like this:

data_check_string = ...
public_key = "<Telegram_public_key>"
if (Ed25519_verify(public_key, data_check_string, signature)) {
  // data is valid and originated from Telegram
}
Telegram provides the following Ed25519 public keys for signature verification:

Test environment: 40055058a4ee38156a06562e52eece92a771bcd8346a8c4615cb7376eddf72ec (hex)
Production: e7bf03a2fa4602af4580703d88dda5bb59f32ed8b02a56c187fe7d34caed242d (hex)

To prevent the use of outdated data, the third party should additionally validate the auth_date field. This field contains a Unix timestamp indicating when the data was received by the Mini App.

Once validated, the data may be used. Complex data types are represented as JSON-serialized objects.

Adding Bots to the Attachment Menu
Attachment menu integration is currently only available for major advertisers on the Telegram Ad Platform. However, all bots can use it in the test server environment. Talk to Botfather on the test server to set up the integration.

A special link is used to add bots to the attachment menu:

https://t.me/botusername?startattach
or
https://t.me/botusername?startattach=command

For example, open this attachment menu link for @DurgerKingBot, then use the Attach menu in any private chat.

Opening the link prompts the user to add the bot to their attachment menu. If the bot has already been added, the attachment menu will open in the current chat and redirect to the bot there (if the link is opened from a 1-on-1 chat). If a non-empty startattach parameter was included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the start_param field and in the GET parameter tgWebAppStartParam.

The following link formats are also supported:

https://t.me/username?attach=botusername
https://t.me/username?attach=botusername&startattach=command
https://t.me/+1234567890?attach=botusername
https://t.me/+1234567890?attach=botusername&startattach=command

These links open the Mini App in the attachment menu in the chat with a specific user. If the bot wasn't already added to the attachment menu, the user will be prompted to do so. If a non-empty startattach parameter was included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the start_param field and in the GET parameter tgWebAppStartParam.

Bot API 6.1+ supports a new link format:

https://t.me/botusername?startattach&choose=users+bots
https://t.me/botusername?startattach=command&choose=groups+channels

Opening such a link prompts the user to choose a specific chat and opens the attachment menu in that chat. If the bot wasn't already added to the attachment menu, the user will be prompted to do so. You can specify which types of chats the user will be able to choose from. It can be one or more of the following types: users, bots, groups, channels separated by a + sign. If a non-empty startattach parameter was included in the link, it will be passed to the Mini App in the start_param field and in the GET parameter tgWebAppStartParam.

Additional Data in User-Agent
When the Mini App is running on Android, additional information is appended to the User-Agent string to provide more context about the app environment. This information includes the app version, device model, Android version, SDK version, and device performance class, formatted as follows:

Telegram-Android/{app_version} ({manufacturer} {model}; Android {android_version}; SDK {sdk_version}; {performance_class})
where:

{app_version} is the version of the Telegram app (e.g., 11.3.3),
{manufacturer} {model} represents the device’s manufacturer and model (e.g., Google sdk_gphone64_arm64),
{android_version} is the Android OS version running on the device (e.g., 14),
{sdk_version} indicates the Android SDK version (e.g., 34),
{performance_class} specifies the device performance class as LOW, AVERAGE, or HIGH, indicating the device's performance capacity.
Example
Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 14; K) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/113.0.5672.136 Mobile Safari/537.36 Telegram-Android/11.3.3 (Google sdk_gphone64_arm64; Android 14; SDK 34; LOW)

We recommend using this information to optimize your Mini App based on the device's capabilities. For instance, you can adjust animations and visual effects in games on low-performance devices to ensure a smooth experience for all users, regardless of device specifications.

Testing Mini Apps
Using bots in the test environment
To log in to the test environment, use either of the following:

iOS: tap 10 times on the Settings icon > Accounts > Login to another account > Test.
Telegram Desktop: open ☰ Settings > Shift + Alt + Right click ‘Add Account’ and select ‘Test Server’.
macOS: click the Settings icon 10 times to open the Debug Menu, ⌘ + click ‘Add Account’ and log in via phone number.
The test environment is completely separate from the main environment, so you will need to create a new user account and a new bot with @BotFather.

After receiving your bot token, you can send requests to the Bot API in this format:

https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/test/METHOD_NAME
Note: When working with the test environment, you may use HTTP links without TLS to test your Mini App.
