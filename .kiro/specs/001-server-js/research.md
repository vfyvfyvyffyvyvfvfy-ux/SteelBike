# Phase 0: Research - Centralized Configuration

## 1. Unknown: Testing Strategy

### 1.1. Research Task
Investigate and recommend a lightweight, effective testing strategy for the existing vanilla JavaScript frontend and Node.js serverless backend. The strategy should be easy to integrate and not require a major architectural refactor.

### 1.2. Findings
- **Frontend (Vanilla JS)**: The simplest approach is to use a minimal assertion library like **Chai** and a test runner like **Mocha**. For DOM-related testing, **JSDOM** can be used to simulate a browser environment in Node.js. This avoids the overhead of full browser automation for simple unit and integration tests.
- **Backend (Vercel Serverless Functions)**: The serverless functions are standard Node.js modules. They can be tested using the same Mocha/Chai stack. To test them as actual endpoints, **Supertest** is a popular library for making HTTP assertions against a running or mocked server.

### 1.3. Decision
- Adopt **Mocha** as the test runner and **Chai** for assertions for both frontend and backend tests.
- Use **JSDOM** for frontend tests that need to interact with a simulated DOM.
- Use **Supertest** for integration testing the API endpoints.

### 1.4. Rationale
This stack is lightweight, has a low learning curve, and is highly flexible. It provides the necessary tools to write unit, integration, and API contract tests without introducing complex frameworks, aligning with the project's principle of simplicity.

### 1.5. Alternatives Considered
- **Jest**: A more integrated, all-in-one framework. Rejected because it's a heavier dependency and might be overkill for the current project scale.
- **Cypress/Playwright**: Full end-to-end browser automation frameworks. Rejected as too slow and complex for the immediate need for unit and integration tests.
